  This implementation was created to work similarly like the Matlab one.


  Parameters:

    a (numpy.ndarray): A 2-dimensional :py:class:`numpy.ndarray` which
      represents the image to be filtered. The dtype of the array is supposed
      to be 64-floats. You can also pass an 8-bit unsigned integer array,
      loaded from a file (for example). In this case it will be scaled as
      with :py:func:`bob.core.convert` and the range reset to ``[0.0, 1.0]``.

    b (numpy.ndarray): A 64-bit float 2-dimensional :py:class:`numpy.ndarray`
      which represents the filter to be applied to the image. The input filter
      has to be rotated by 180 degrees as we use
      :py:func:`scipy.signal.convolve2d` to apply it. You can rotate your
      filter ``b`` with the help of :py:func:`bob.ip.base.rotate`.
